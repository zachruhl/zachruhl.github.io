# Homework #2 (20 points)

### Getting Started

1. Download this repository, rename it as "hw2", and put it under your "code" folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. You'll see one large image, and several thumbnail images.

Your job is to write JavaScript code so that when
the user clicks on a thumbnail image, that image
becomes the large main image as well.

Use the GitHub app to convert your hw2 folder into
a local repository, and the publish it to GitHub as
a remote repository named `hw2`.

Finally, use Canvas to turn in your assignment by providing the full URL to your repository.

### HINTS

* When inside of an event handle function, you can use `$(this)` to refer to the element
  that generated the event.
* The `.attr()` function has two uses: it can set an element's attribute to a given value,
  or it can retrieve the current value of an attribute. See [W3School's documentation for examples](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/html_attr.asp).
* You shouldn't need to modify the HTML, only the `index.js` file.
