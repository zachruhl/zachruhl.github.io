# Week 2

This week we will present formal definitions of HTML elements,
learn about the CSS language for visual styling,
and begin to get an inside look at how the browser draws everything
on your screen.

The `index.html` has been provided as a starting point for you.

## HTML Primer

This week, please do the [HTML 101](html101.pdf) workbook.  

You'll notice that didn't say to read it, I said to *do* it.  It's intended
to be a type-along.  You probably won't have any aha! moments unless you
code along and see what happens in the browser as you type.


## CSS

If you want to learn more about CSS, try the [W3Schools Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/).

## View the Source & the Inspector

You MUST get very familiar at how to view the source code of any website, and
also how to invoke the Inspector window.  Learn the keyboard shortcuts for both
so that you can toggle them at a moment's notice without thinking.


## Slack

You best option if you have a question is Slack.  Go to the `#kiei-924` channel and post
your question.  

Do NOT post screenshots of code, only rendered browser pages.  To share code, first
make sure that your preferences are setup correctly:
